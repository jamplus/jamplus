\section jambase_intro Introduction

By default, <tt>Jambase.jam</tt> is the first Jam file loaded by Jam.

\section jambase_missing_rules Missing rules

The default <tt>Jambase.jam</tt> provides implementation of the missing rule function \c FindMissingRule. That means that Jam makes a good attempt at automatically finding rules that have not been specifically loaded by a script via \c IncludeModule or \c include or similar mechanism.  \c FindMissingRule splits the rule name into its components (separated by periods) and then searches the disk for a file of the component name.  Each component file found is loaded and tested for the rule name.

For example, if the script asks for <tt>C.Application</tt>, Jam loads <tt>modules/c.jam</tt> and looks for a <tt>C.Application</tt> rule.  It will find the <tt>C.Application</tt> rule and execute it.

As another example, if the script calls \c CopyFile, Jam will look in <tt>modules/copyfile.jam</tt> for the \c CopyFile rule.

If the script wants to execute the rule <tt>Assets.Build.Something</tt>, the following happens:

  -# <tt>modules/assets.jam</tt> is loaded.  A test is performed for the rule <tt>Assets.Build.Something</tt>.  If it is found, it is executed.
  -# <tt>modules/assets/build.jam</tt> is loaded.  A test is performed for the existence of the rule <tt>Assets.Build.Something</tt>.
  -# <tt>modules/assets/build/something.jam</tt> is loaded.  A test is performed for the existence of the rule <tt>Assets.Build.Something</tt>.
  -# Assuming the search made it this far, the rule <tt>Assets.Build.Something</tt> does not exist.  Now, Jam begins looking for a more generic rule called <tt>Assets.Build.Something.*</tt>.
  -# If that is not found, <tt>Assets.Build.*</tt> is searched for.
  -# If that is not found, <tt>Assets.*</tt> is searched for.
  -# If any are found, <tt>\$(__MISSING_RULE_COMPONENTS)</tt> is filled in with the string list <tt>Assets Build Something</tt>.  <tt>\$(__MISSING_RULE_SCAN_LIST)</tt> is filled in with the rules that were searched for and can be used for error reporting.


The following is a list of rules available in <tt>bin/Jambase.jam</tt>.

If [square] brackets are used the argument is optional.

<hr>
\section rule_ActiveTarget rule ActiveTarget TARGET
\addindex rule_ActiveTarget

Set the default target to use when the target isn't specified.  Calls \ref rule_C_ActiveTarget under the hood.

\param TARGET The default target name to use for upcoming rules.







<hr>
\section rule_AutoSourceGroup rule AutoSourceGroup [ TARGET ] [ : SOURCES ]
\addindex rule_AutoSourceGroup

For workspace projects that support grouping of files into folders, the \c AutoSourceGroup rule is used to tell the <pre>jam --workspace</pre> generator to create folders within a project based on the relative paths of the \c SOURCES.

\param TARGET (optional) The project for which the folders will be created. If no project is specified, \c AutoSourceGroup will be automatically applied to all projects.
\param SOURCES (optional) The list of files to derive folder names from.

\code

    # Put helloworld.cpp and .h in the top-level project folder.
    # Put filename.cpp and .h in a project folder called platform\\directory (in SourceGroup syntax).
    SRCS =
            helloworld.cpp
            helloworld.h
            platform/directory/filename.cpp
            platform/directory/filename.h
    ;

    # Apply to every project:
    AutoSourceGroup ;

    # or just a specific project:
    AutoSourceGroup MyProject : $(SRCS) ;
\endcode







<hr>
\section rule_Clean rule Clean TARGETS : FILES
\addindex rule_Clean

When executing actions for \c TARGETS, the specified list of \c FILES are removed from the disk, and any empty directories resulting from the file deletions are removed, too.

\param TARGETS A list of one or more targets.  Generally, the target name is \c clean or <tt>clean:SOMETARGET</tt>.
\param FILES A list of files to be deleted.

\code
    Clean clean : <mytarget>myfile.txt $(TEMP)/anotherfile.txt ;
\endcode






<hr>
\section rule_CleanTree rule CleanTree TARGETS : DIRECTORIES
\addindex rule_CleanTree

When executing actions for \c TARGETS, the specified list of \c DIRECTORIES are removed from the disk.

\param TARGETS A list of one or more targets.  Generally, the target name is \c clean or <tt>clean:SOMETARGET</tt>.
\param DIRECTORIES A list of directories to be deleted.

\code
    CleanTree clean : $(TEMP)/a/directory ;
\endcode






<hr>
\section rule_ExternalProject rule ExternalProject PROJECT_NAME : PROJECT_PATH
\addindex rule_ExternalProject

When generating a workspace, it can sometimes be useful to include projects that are not generated by the Jam workspace generator. These projects can be made available via a combination of the \c ExternalProject and \c Workspace rules.

Currently, only external projects are supported within Visual Studio 201x and must be either <tt>.vcxproj</tt> or <tt>.csproj</tt> project files.

\param PROJECT_NAME The name of the project.
\param PROJECT_PATH The path to the project file to include in the workspace.

\code
    ExternalProject MyClassLibrary : $(TOP)/MyClassLibrary/MyClassLibrary.csproj ;
    Workspace testapp : MyClassLibrary ;
\endcode







<hr>
\section rule_FGristDirectories rule FGristDirectories DIRECTORIES
\addindex rule_FGristDirectories

Given a list of \c DIRECTORIES, a gristed version of each is returned.  Currently, this means the directories are returned in the form: <tt>&lt;!dir!&gt;directory/name</tt>

\param DIRECTORIES The directories to grist.
\return Returns the gristed version of each directory.

\code
    Echo [ FGristDirectories $(TEMP)/stuff ] ;
\endcode






<hr>
\section rule_IncludeModule rule IncludeModule MODULE_NAME
\addindex rule_IncludeModule

Loads a Jam module.  It searches in the following manner:

<ul>
  <li>The current <tt>\$(SUBDIR)</tt></li>
  <li>The current working directory <tt>\$(CWD)</tt></li>
  <li>The current working directory <tt>\$(CWD)/jam/</tt></li>
  <li><tt>\$(JAM_MODULES_USER_PATH)</tt></li>
  <li><tt>\$(JAM_MODULES_PATH)</tt> which includes the <tt>bin/modules/</tt> directory</li>
</ul>

When \c IncludeModule is specified more than once for the same \c MODULE_NAME, the module is only loaded once.

\param MODULE_NAME The name of the module, which is the filename without an extension.
\return Returns the module name if successful.  If the \c MODULE_NAME was not found, nothing is returned.

\code
    # Make the C.UseDirectX rule available.
    IncludeModule c/directx ;
\endcode







<hr>
\section rule_MakeLocate rule MakeLocate TARGETS : DIRECTORY : OPTIONS
\addindex rule_MakeLocate

Creates \c DIRECTORY and causes \c TARGETS to be built into the directory.  It does so by setting the special Jam variable \c LOCATE on each of the \c TARGETS and then arranges with \ref rule_MkDir to create the target directory.

\param TARGETS The targets to set the output directory on.
\param DIRECTORY The output directory to build the targets into.
\param OPTIONS If \c combine is specified, then any directory attached to the \c TARGETS name is created, and a \c BINDING is set to allow the target to work properly.

\code
    # Set the output location of the given target to be the TEMP directory.
    MakeLocate junkfile.txt : $(TEMP) ;

    # Creates the directory $(TEMP)/abc/def, sets the LOCATE for target abc/def/file.txt
    # to $(TEMP)/abc/def and sets the BINDING to be file.txt.
    MakeLocate abc/def/file.txt : $(TEMP) : combine ;
\endcode







<hr>
\section rule_MkDir rule MkDir DIRECTORY
\addindex rule_MkDir

Creates \c DIRECTORY and its parent directories.

If using \c MkDir separately from \ref rule_MakeLocate, it is necessary to set dependencies using the properly gristed directory name obtained through \ref rule_FGristDirectories.

\param DIRECTORY The output directory to create.

\code
    # Create a directory in the TEMP directory called stuff/.
    MkDir $(TEMP)/stuff ;

    # Link it into the dependency graph.
    Depends sometarget : [ FGristDirectories $(TEMP)/stuff ] ;
\endcode







<hr>
\section rule_NoWorkspace rule NoWorkspace WORKSPACE_NAME
\addindex rule_NoWorkspace

Workspaces are automatically generated for any executable processed while reading in the Jamfiles.  To prevent a workspace from automatically exporting, this rule is used.

\param WORKSPACE_NAME The name of the new workspace to suppress the export of.

\code
	NoWorkspace lua ;
\endcode






<hr>
\section rule_Project rule Project PROJECT_NAME : SOURCES
\addindex rule_Project

When generating a workspace, projects are automatically made of each executable or library processed while reading in the Jamfiles.  When a project isn't an executable or library, such as one containing data files, the \c Project rule can be used to generate a project containing those files.

\param PROJECT_NAME The name of the new project to generate.
\param SOURCES The list of files representing the contents of the new project.

\code
    Project Data : $(DATA_FILES) ;
\endcode







<hr>
\section rule_ProjectGroup rule ProjectGroup TARGET : FOLDERNAME : PROJECTS
\addindex rule_ProjectGroup

For workspaces that support grouping of projects into folders, the \c ProjectGroup rule is used to tell <b>JamToWorkspace</b> which projects go into which folders.

\param TARGET The workspace to which the project folders will be created.
\param FOLDERNAME The backslash separated folder name to which \c PROJECTS will be inserted into.
\param PROJECTS The list of projects to put into the folder.

\code
    ProjectGroup MyApp : "Plugins\\Data Generators" : DataGeneratorA DataGeneratorB ;
\endcode







<hr>
\section rule_RmTemps rule RmTemps TARGETS : SOURCES
\addindex rule_RmTemps

Marks \c SOURCES as temporary with the \c Temporary rule and deletes \c SOURCES once \c TARGETS are built.  \c RmTemps must be the last rule invoked on \c TARGETS.  Used internally.







<hr>
\section rule_SearchSource rule SearchSource SOURCES
\addindex rule_SearchSource

Applies \$(SEARCH_SOURCE) to all \c SOURCES that do not already have a \c SEARCH applied.  Generally, \c SEARCH_SOURCE is applied through rules just as \c Application or \c Library.

\param SOURCES The list of sources to apply \$(SEARCH_SOURCE) to.

\code
	SearchSource $(SRCS) ;
\endcode







<hr>
\section rule_SourceGroup rule SourceGroup TARGET : FOLDERNAME : SOURCES
\addindex rule_SourceGroup

For workspace projects that support grouping of files into folders, the \c SourceGroup rule is used to tell <b>JamToWorkspace</b> which files are to be placed into which folders within a project.

\param TARGET The project to which the folders will be created.
\param FOLDERNAME The backslash separated folder name to which \c SOURCES will be inserted.
\param SOURCES The list of files to put into the folder.

\code
	SourceGroup Misc : "zlib" : $(ZLIB_SRCS) ;
	SourceGroup Misc : "string\\trio" : $(TRIO_SRCS) ;
\endcode







<hr>
\section rule_SubDir rule SubDir TOP d1...dn : SUBNAME
\addindex rule_SubDir

Sets up housekeeping for the source files located in <tt>$(TOP)/d1/.../dn</tt>:

<ul>
<li>Reads in rules file associated with \c TOP, if it hasn't already been read.</li>
<li>Initializes subdirectory specific variables for search paths, output directories, compiler flags, and grist, using <tt>d1...dn</tt> tokens.
</ul>

\c TOP is the name of a variable; \c d1 thru \c dn are elements of a directory path.







<hr>
\section rule_SubInclude rule SubInclude VAR d1...dn : FILETITLE
\addindex rule_SubInclude

Reads the Jamfile in <tt>$(VAR)/d1/.../dn/</tt>.  Assumes a default Jamfile name of <tt>Jamfile.jam</tt>.  If \c FILETITLE is specified, <tt>$(FILETITLE).jam</tt> is read instead of <tt>Jamfile.jam</tt>.

A given Jamfile is only ever read in once, even if multiple \c SubInclude calls are made with the same arguments.

\param VAR A previously specified \c TOP variable created with \ref rule_SubDir.
\param d1...dn Additional directory components from $(VAR) making up the total path of <tt>$(VAR)/d1/.../dn/</tt>.
\param FILETITLE (optional) If specified, a Jamfile called <tt>$(FILETITLE).jam</tt> is read instead of the default <tt>Jamfile.jam</tt>.






<hr>
\section rule_SubIncludeRelative rule SubIncludeRelative RELATIVE_PATH : FILETITLE
\addindex rule_SubIncludeRelative

After a \c SubDir rule has been called, \c SubIncludeRelative can be used to move within the \c SubDir structure.  Currently, it only works traversing into child directories.  It cannot be used with a <tt>..</tt> to move to a parent directory.

Further information may be found in \ref rule_SubInclude "SubInclude".

\param RELATIVE_PATH The relative child directory to move into.
\param FILETITLE (optional) If specified, a Jamfile called <tt>$(FILETITLE).jam</tt> is read instead of the default <tt>Jamfile.jam</tt>.

\code
    SubDir TOP ;

    # ...

    SubIncludeRelative MyProject ;  # The same as: SubInclude TOP MyProject
\endcode






<hr>
\section rule_Workspace rule Workspace WORKSPACE_NAME : TARGETS
\addindex rule_Workspace

Workspaces are automatically generated for any executable processed while reading in the Jamfiles.  To create additional workspaces, such as one that combines all executables into one workspace, the \c Workspace rule is used.

\param WORKSPACE_NAME The name of the new workspace to generate.
\param TARGETS The list of targets representing the projects of the new workspace.

\code
	Workspace Project-all : AppA AppB AppC ;
\endcode






<hr>
\section rule_WorkspaceConfig rule WorkspaceConfig WORKSPACE_NAME : CONFIG_NAME : JAM_CONFIG_NAME : COMMAND_LINE
\addindex rule_WorkspaceConfig

Usually, configurations are created in a workspace according to the \c VALID_CONFIGS variable found within the generated workspace's <tt>Jambase.jam</tt>. These configurations can come from the defaults or from a config file passed to 'jam --workspace'.

Using the \c WorkspaceConfig rule, the default generated configurations can be overridden for a given generated workspace/solution.

Each user-specified workspace config gets its Jam command-line replaced entirely with the one specified on the WorkspaceConfig invocation. For that reason, it is very important to provide the <tt>C.TOOLCHAIN</tt> variable to the command-line, or Jam will not know what compiler, platform, and configuration it is building.

Please make note that workspace configurations are not Jam configurations, so confusion may arise. Assumptions about output and intermediate directories are made based on the platform and config specified via <tt>C.TOOLCHAIN</tt>. Unless Jam rules are altered from the shipping defaults, there is not a unique intermediate and output location per provided \c WorkspaceConfig.

In reality, a \c WorkspaceConfig is a hack. Just modify the generated <tt>customsettings.jam</tt> file instead, as it better represents what is actually happening within the build.

\param WORKSPACE_NAME The name of the workspace to modify.
\param CONFIG_NAME The name of the new configuration for the workspace.
\param JAM_CONFIG_NAME The name of the Jam build configuration being built on top of.
\param COMMAND_LINE Any additional command line parameters to pass on the Jam command-line for this \c CONFIG_NAME.

\code
    # Generate workspaces with the following configs:
    #
    #   * debug_d3d
    #   * debug_opengl
    #   * debug_sdl
    #   * release_d3d
    #   * release_opengl
    #   * release_sdl
    if $(TARGETINFO_LOCATE) {
        local config ;
        for config in debug release {
            local engine ;
            for engine in d3d opengl sdl {
                local dollar = $ ;
                WorkspaceConfig $(THE_WORKSPACE_NAME) : $(config)_$(engine) : $(config) : C.TOOLCHAIN=$(dollar)(PLATFORM)/$(config) THE_ENGINE=$(engine) ;
            }
        }
    }
\endcode

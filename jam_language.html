Introduction</h1>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="operation_main"></a>
Operation</h1>
<p>Jam has four phases of operation: start-up, parsing, binding, and updating.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="operation_start-up"></a>
Start-up Phase</h2>
<p>Upon start-up, Jam imports environment variable settings into Jam variables. Environment variables are split at blanks with each word becoming an element in the variable's list of values. Environment variables whose names end in <code>PATH</code> are split at $(SPLITPATH) characters (e.g., <code>";"</code> for Windows and <code>":"</code> for Unix).</p>
<p>To set a variable's value on the command line, overriding the variable's environment value, use a <code>KEY=VALUE</code> syntax.</p>
<p>(To see variable assignments made during jam's execution, use the <code>-d+7</code> option.)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="operation_parsing"></a>
Parsing Phase</h2>
<p>In the parsing phase, <b>Jam</b> reads and executes the <code>Jambase.jam</code> file. It finds a <code>Jambase.jam</code> file by looking for one in the current working directory. If the <code>Jambase.jam</code> is not found in the current directory, the <code>Jambase.jam</code> sitting side-by-side with or one level up from the <b>Jam</b> executable is read in.</p>
<p>The <code>Jambase</code> file is written in the <b>Jam</b> <a class="el" href="jam_language.html#language_main">Language</a>. The last action of the <code>Jambase</code> is to read (via the "include" rule) a user-provided file called "<code>Jamfile.jam</code>".</p>
<p>Collectively, the purpose of the <code>Jambase</code> and the <code>Jamfile</code> is to name built target and source files, construct the dependency graph among them, and associate build actions with targets. The <code>Jambase</code> defines boilerplate rules and variable assignments, and the <code>Jamfile</code> uses these to specify the actual relationship among the target and source files. See the <a class="el" href="jambase_rules.html">Jambase Rules</a> document for information.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="operation_binding"></a>
Binding Phase</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="operation_binding_binding"></a>
Binding</h3>
<p>parsing, <b>Jam</b> recursively descends the dependency graph and binds every file target with a location in the filesystem.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="operation_binding_targets"></a>
Targets</h3>
<p>Any string value in <b>Jam</b> can represent a target, and it does so if the <a class="el" href="builtin_rules.html#rule_Depends">Depends</a>, <a class="el" href="builtin_rules.html#rule_Includes">Includes</a>, or <a class="el" href="builtin_rules.html#rule_Needs">Needs</a> rules make it part of the dependency graph. <em>Build targets</em> are files to be updated. <em>Source targets</em> are the files used in updating build targets. Build targets and source targets are collectively referred to as file targets, and frequently build targets are source targets for other build targets. <em>Pseudotargets</em> are symbols which represent dependencies on other targets, but which are not themselves associated with any real file.</p>
<p>A file target's identifier is generally the file's name, which can be absolutely rooted, relative to the directory of jam's invocation, or simply local (no directory). Most often it is the last case, and the actual file path is bound using the $(BINDING), $(SEARCH), and $(LOCATE) special variables. See <a class="el" href="builtin_variables.html#built_in_variables_binding_binding_search_locate">BINDING, SEARCH, and LOCATE Variables</a>. A local filename is optionally qualified with "grist," a string value used to assure uniqueness. A file target with an identifier of the form <em>file(member)</em> is a library member (usually an ar(1) archive on UNIX).</p>
<p>The use of $(BINDING), $(SEARCH), and $(LOCATE) allows <b>Jam</b> to separate the the location of files from their names, so that Jamfiles can refer to files locally (i.e. relative to the Jamfile's directory), yet still be usable when <b>Jam</b> is invoked from a distant directory. The use of grist allows files with the same name to be identified uniquely, so that <b>Jam</b> can read a whole directory tree of Jamfiles and not mix up same-named targets.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="operation_binding_update_determination"></a>
Update Determination</h3>
<p>After binding each target, <b>Jam</b> determines whether the target needs updating, and, if so, marks the target for the updating phase. A target is normally so marked if it is missing, md5 command line flags have changed, is older than any of its sources, or any of its sources are marked for updating. This behavior can be modified by the application of special built-in rules. See <a class="el" href="builtin_rules.html#language_built_in_rules_modifying_binding">Modifying Binding</a>.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="operation_binding_header_file_scanning"></a>
Header File Scanning</h3>
<p>During the binding phase, <b>Jam</b> also performs "header" file scanning, where it looks inside source files for the implicit dependencies on other files caused by C's #include syntax (or whatever is appropriate for other file formats). This is controlled by the special variables $(HDRSCAN) and $(HDRRULE). The result of the scan is formed into a rule invocation, with the scanned file as the target and the found included file names as the sources. Note that this is the only case where rules are invoked outside the parsing phase. See <a class="el" href="builtin_variables.html#built_in_variables_hdrscan">Header Scanning Variables</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="operation_updating"></a>
Updating Phase</h2>
<p>After binding, <b>Jam</b> again recursively descends the dependency graph, this time executing the update actions for each target marked for update during the binding phase. If a target's updating actions fail, then all other targets which depend on that target are skipped.</p>
<p>The <code>-j</code> flag instructs jam to build more than one target at a time. If there are multiple actions on a single target, they are run sequentially. The <code>-g</code> flag reorders builds so that targets with newest sources are built first. Normally, they are built in the order of appearance in the Jamfiles.</p>

 <h1><a class="anchor" id="language_main"></a>
Language</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="language_overview"></a>
Overview</h2>
<p>Jam has a interpreted, procedural language with a few select features to effect program construction. Statements in jam are rule (procedure) definitions, rule invocations, updating action definitions, flow-of-control structures, variable assignments, and sundry language support.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="language_lexical_features"></a>
Lexical Features</h2>
<p><b>Jam</b> treats its input files as whitespace-separated tokens, with two exceptions: double quotes (\") can enclose whitespace to embed it into a token, and everything between the matching curly braces ({}) in the definition of a updating actions is treated as a single string. A backslash () can escape a double quote, or any single whitespace character. Both a newline and a tab must be represented physically within quotes. There is no backslash escape for them.</p>
<p><b>Jam</b> requires whitespace (blanks, tabs, or newlines) to surround all tokens, <b>including the colon (:) and semicolon (;) tokens</b>. If a colon or semicolon is found and is not surrounded by whitespace, an error is raised unless the colon or semicolon and surrounding content is in double quotes.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor"># Parses successfully.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="preprocessor"></span>MyRule arg1 : arg2 : arg3 ;</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line"><span class="preprocessor"># Does not parse due to the colon at the end of Error.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="preprocessor"></span>Echo Error: This won<span class="stringliteral">&#39;t work! ;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"># Parses successfully.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">Echo &quot;Error: This works fine!&quot; ;</span></div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p><b>Jam</b> keywords (as mentioned in this document) are reserved and generally must be quoted with double quotes (") to be used as arbitrary tokens, such as variable or target names.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="language_datatype"></a>
Datatype</h2>
<p><b>Jam</b>'s only data type is a one-dimensional list of arbitrary strings. They arise as literal (whitespace-separated) tokens in the Jambase or included files, as the result of variable expansion of those tokens, or as the return value from a rule invocation.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">variableName = hello ;</div>
<div class="line">listOfStrings = hello hi bonjour hola! <span class="stringliteral">&quot;how are you?&quot;</span> <span class="stringliteral">&quot;i am fine.&quot;</span> ;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h2><a class="anchor" id="language_rules"></a>
Rules</h2>
<p>The basic <b>Jam</b> language entity is called a rule. A rule is simply a procedure definition, with a body of <b>Jam</b> statements to be run when the rule is invoked. The syntax of rule invocation make it possible to write Jamfiles that look a bit like Makefiles.</p>
<p>Rules take up to 9 arguments ($(1) through $(9), each a list) and can have a return value (a single list). A rule's return value can be expanded in a list by enclosing the rule invocation with [ and ].</p>
<p>Rule names can be expanded in place using the same techniques as described in language_variable_expansion.</p>

</div><!-- fragment --><h2><a class="anchor" id="language_updating_actions"></a>
Updating Actions</h2>
<p>A rule may have updating actions associated with it, in which case arguments $(1) and $(2) are treated as built targets and sources, respectively. Updating actions are the OS shell commands to execute when updating the built targets of the rule.</p>
<p>When a rule with updating actions is invoked, those actions are added to those associated with its built targets ($(1)) before the rule's procedure is run. Later, to build the targets in the updating phase, the actions are passed to the OS command shell, with $(1) and $(2) replaced by bound versions of the target names. See <a class="el" href="jam_language.html#operation_binding">Binding Phase</a> above.</p>

Statements</h2>
<p><a class="anchor" id="actions_autosettings"></a><a class="anchor" id="actions_lua"></a><a class="anchor" id="actions_removeemptydirs"></a><a class="anchor" id="actions_screenoutput"></a> <code>Jam</code>'s language has the following statements:</p>
 <blockquote> <p><code><em>rulename</em> <em>field1</em> : <em>field2</em> : ... : <em>fieldN</em> ;</code></p>
 <blockquote> <p>Invoke a rule. A rule is invoked with values in <em>field1</em> through <em>fieldN</em> (9 max). They may be referenced in the procedure's <em>statements</em> as $(1) through $(&lt;9&gt;N). $(&lt;) and $(&gt;) are synonymous with $(1) and $(2).</p>
<p><em>rulename</em> undergoes language_variable_expansion. If the resulting list is more than one value, each rule is invoked with the same arguments, and the result of the invocation is the concatenation of all the results.</p>
 </blockquote> <p><code>actions [ <em>modifiers</em> ] <em>rulename</em> { <em>commands</em> }</code></p>
 <blockquote> <p>Define a rule's updating actions, replacing any previous definition. The first two arguments may be referenced in the action's <em>commands</em> as $(1) and $(2) or $(&lt;) and $(&gt;).</p>
<p>Normally, the settings from $(1) are made active during the run of the action. Sometimes, it is useful to make additional settings available. If a third optional argument is provided, the settings assigned to the third target are activated during the action. $(1)'s settings take precedence over the third argument.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" name="bugs">Bugs, Limitations </a></h1>The -j flag can cause <b>Jam</b> to get confused when single actions update more than one target at a time. <b>Jam</b> may proceed as if the targets were built even though they are still under construction.<p>
For parallel building to be successful, the dependencies among files must be properly spelled out, as targets tend to get built in a quickest-first ordering. Also, beware of un-parallelizable commands that drop fixed-named files into the current directory, like <b>yacc</b>(1) does.<p>
With the <code>-j</code> flag, errors from failed commands can get staggeringly mixed up.<p>
A poorly set <code>$(JAMSHELL)</code> is likely to result in silent failure. </div>
